== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the button appearance? =

Go to Settings > Back to Top in your ClassicPress admin. You'll find comprehensive options for colors, shapes, sizes, shadows, borders, and positioning. The interface includes live previews and easy-to-use controls.

= Can I change the button colors? =

Yes! The plugin includes a custom color picker with preset colors and hex input. You can customize background color, hover color, text color, shadow color, and border color independently.

= What button shapes are available? =

Choose from Circle (perfect round), Square (sharp corners), or Custom (adjustable rounded corners with 0-50% roundness control via slider).

= Can I add shadows and borders? =

Absolutely! Enable drop shadows with customizable color and intensity (10-80%). Add borders with custom colors and widths (1-8px). Both features can be used together or independently.

Yes! The button automatically scales down 5px on mobile devices and all touch interactions work perfectly. The responsive design ensures great usability across all devices.

= Does it work with all themes? =

The plugin is designed to work with any ClassicPress theme. It uses high-specificity CSS and !important declarations to ensure your custom styling takes priority over theme styles.

= How do I choose different symbols for the button? =

Use the Quick Symbol Select buttons to instantly choose popular symbols (↑, ⬆, ▲, ⇧, TOP, UP) or enter any custom text or Unicode symbol in the text field.
